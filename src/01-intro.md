# Introduction

Welcome to _The Melodeon Programming Language_, an introductory book about Melodeon, Themelio's official covenant programming language. Covenants are used in Themelio's [rich coin-based transaction model](https://docs.themelio.org/basic-concepts/02-state/) to represent conditions under which a coin/UTXO can be spent.

Melodeon is an functional, structurally typed, non-Turing-complete programming language that compiles to [MelVM](https://docs.themelio.org/specifications/melvm-specification/), Themelio's native covenant representation. By using Melodeon, you can write covenants ranging from simple multisignature wallets to complex on-chain mechanisms in a an ergonomic, type-safe environment in which to write complex covenant systems.
