# Install melorun

In this tutorial of Melodeon, we won't start by deploying full Melodeon programs to the Themelio blockchain. Instead, we use a command-line tool to run and test Melodeon programs **locally**, called `melorun`.

If you have the [Rust compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed, the easiest way is simply the following:

```
cargo install melorun
```

(If you don't have Rust, you can download it from [its website](https://rust-lang.org/))
